1. add more hooks at replay.c
a) Refer to record_open as example, add the open_ahgv struct for what you need.
b) In the record_open, add AHG_ARGSKMALLOC to append the ahgv strcut to the linked list.

2. add more handler at test/parse_ahglib.c
a) add the definition of open_ahgv struct in parse_ahglib.h (make sure it is identical as in the kernel!!!)
b) add DEFRULE_AHG(sysnr, size, ahgsize)
c) add what you want to get in the read_psr_chunk

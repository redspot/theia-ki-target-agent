Growing concerns over privacy issues in server-based social networks
challenge the centralized architecture where users' personal data
are concentrated at the service provider. We propose \sys, a decentralized 
infrastructure to host a private, in-browser social network. Users are able to reach
\sys just with the browser, free from any kind of installation
effort, then embrace the privacy brought by the purely decentralized
architecture. For hosting a decentralized, yet usable and scalable,
social network, specifically we design, implement and evaluate 1) 
a signaling and friendship exchange service that offers end-to-end 
data privacy/security and light-weight deployment with no 
computing requirement at all; 2) a client only logic including
a flooding-based post delivery 
overlay network with which messages can reach both online and 
offline users with low latency.
Evaluation results show that with minimal infrastructure deployment
and flexible bootstrapping methods, \sys is able to effectively
accommodate a social network with several millions of concurrent users.

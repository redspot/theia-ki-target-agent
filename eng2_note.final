==============================Full system logging and recording (NFS)==========================

** Make sure that target and analysis hosts mount NFS at /data

0. Reboot target host, and replayer1.

1. For fresh start 
 - go to target host, then run:
   $ rm /data/ahg.dump.* /data/replay_* -rf
 - GUI login target host as steve.
 - go to analysis host, run:
 - $ rm theia-ki-analysis-dump-* -rf
 - login db (10.0.6.209) as theia and run :
   $ psql -U theia -h localhost -f clear.sql

2. Start logging and recording (at target host)
 - $ theia-es/scripts/insert_spec.sh
 - $ sudo mount -t debugfs debugfs /debug
 - $ cd theia-es/host-agent/
 - $ sudo su;
 - # relay-reader/relay-read-file &
 - It will start to write ahg.dump.* at /data
 - # ./theia_toggle logging on (start logging)
 - # ./theia_toggle recording on (start recording)
 (logging and recording can be run seperately)

3. Start cdm generation (at analysis host)
 - $ cd theia-es/analysis-agent/queue_server_file/
 - $ ./ahg_queue_file --no_neo4j --with_cdm 10.0.50.19:9092 ta1-theia-bovia-cdm17 null --is_seq 1 1
 * (change kafka server for each TA2 accordingly; localdump.file is the dumped binary file) 
 - It will continuously process ahg.dump.* at /data

4. Start query reader (at replayer1)
 - $ sudo reboot 
 - $ theia-es/scripts/insert_spec.sh
 - $ cd theia-es/query_reader
 - $ ./query_reader 10.0.50.19:9092 ta1-theia-q


** Crash handle
If the target host crashes, follow the following instruction:
a) Let the ahg_queue_file at analysis host run until it is idling (no more output to screen), then kill it.
b) $ rm /data/ahg.dump.*
c) Force reset at target host, then do 2, 3.

If the ahg_queue_file crashes, there are two options:

One) with rebooting target host:
a) at target host, turn off recording and logging: 
 - $ cd theia-es/host-agent/ 
 - $ sudo su
 - ./theia_toggle recording off
 - ./theia_toggle logging off
b) rm /data/ahg.dump.*
c) reboot target host
d) do 2, 3

Two) without rebooting target host (it is best the crash is spotted immediately):
a) check the dying line from console (use timestamp to map, 1494...) and find it in ahg.dump.[dump_num], get to know 
how many events (->num_evt) have it consumed.
b) ./ahg_queue_file --no_neo4j --with_cdm 10.0.50.19:9092 ta1-theia-bovia-cdm17 null --is_seq dump_num num_evt+1
 - for example, if we find the last line at the death of ahg_queue_file is line 94 in ahg.dump.2, then we run:
 - $ ./ahg_queue_file --no_neo4j --with_cdm 10.0.50.19:9092 ta1-theia-bovia-cdm17 null --is_seq 2 95
** this will resume from ahg.dump.2 number 95 event.

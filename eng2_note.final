==============================Full system logging and recording (NFS)==========================

** Make sure that target and analysis hosts mount NFS at /data

0. Reboot both target and analysis host

1. For fresh start 
 - go to target host, then run:
   $ rm /data/* -rf
 - login db (10.0.6.209) as theia and run :
   $ psql -U theia -h localhost -f clear.sql

2. Start logging and recording (at target host)
 - $ theia-es/scripts/insert_spec.sh
 - $ cd theia-es/host-agent/
 - $ sudo su;
 - # relay-reader/relay-read-file &
 - It will start to write ahg.dump.* at /data
 - # ./theia_toggle logging on (start logging)
 - # ./theia_toggle recording on (start recording)
 (logging and recording can be run seperately)

3. Start cdm generation (at analysis host)
 - $ cd theia-es/analysis-agent/queue_server_file/
 - $ ./ahg_queue_file --no_neo4j --with_cdm 10.0.50.19:9092 ta1-theia-bovia-cdm17 localdump.file --is_seq
 * (change kafka server for each TA2 accordingly; localdump.file is the dumped binary file) 
 - It will continuously process ahg.dump.* at /data

4. Start query reader (at replayer1)
 - $ sudo reboot 
 - $ theia-es/scripts/insert_spec.sh
 - $ cd theia-es/query_reader
 - $ ./query_reader 10.0.50.19:9092 ta1-theia-q

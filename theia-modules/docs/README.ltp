after installing Linux Test Project to /opt/ltp, do this to test different syscalls:

```
sudo cp theia-modules/docs/*.suite /opt/ltp/runtest
sudo -i
cd /opt/ltp

#if you want to clear out previous logs
#rm results/* output/*

#if you want to control the exact names of output files
./runltp -f shim0.suite -l shim0.log -o shim0.out -C shim0.failed -T shim0.tconf
#if you dont care about the output filenames
./runltp -f shim0.suite
```

there are currently 4 suites to test with:
shim0.suite
shim1.suite
shim2.suite
inotify.suite

each shimN.suite will test all of the SIMPLE_SHIMs with N arguments.
the inotify.suite will test all the syscalls related to inotify.

Currently the UI piece only logs UI info to the ahg, but doesn't have the CDM part.

To be able to log UI info, you'll need to run our custom orca with the command "orca --debug-file=orca.txt" in your home directory. You'll also need to fix the "magic" in replay.c to point to the right Orca log file. 

You can find the custom orca at the repo: theia-orca. General instuctions to build it is:
1) ./autogen.sh (and entertain all the complains about missing packages)
2) make
3) sudo make install

You can turn off all the printk from the UI piece by setting uiDebug to 0 in replay.c.

You can turn off UI logging by setting uiLogging to 0 in replay.c

The output from the UI to the ahg is under "system call number" 666 (I cannot imagine any sane person to have claimed that....), the format is the same as for system call number 45, but with one extra string at the end (i.e. one more |%s| before endahg).
